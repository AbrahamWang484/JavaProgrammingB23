5.Creating an email

                    Ask user to enter fullname. FirstName and lastName should be at least 6 character long.
                    If they are shorter than that print “Invalid data” and program should end.
                    If the information provided is valid, you will take the first 4 characters of first string and combine them with the last three characters of the second string. At the end of your combined string add “@cybertek.com” and print the final string as your created email.
                    The final email should be in all lowercase.

                    input: JamesBond Secret
                    output: jameret@cybertek.com
