Topics: static import
		Constructors Intro

Package name: day41_CustomClass_Constructor


static import vs regular import

	regular import:imports everything from the class
		import PackageName.className;
		import PackageName.*;

	static import: used for importing static members of the class ONLY
		 import static PackageName.className.staticMember;
		 import static PackageName.className.*;


regular methods: function

	Access-Modifier   Specifier  Return-Type  methodName(Parameter){

	}


Constructors: Special method. every class MUST have constructor
			used for creating the objects of the class

			execution o constructor depends on the object

			syntax:
				Access-Modifier className(Parameter){
				}

6 Rules for Constructor:
1.call constructor through this()
2. only constructor can call another constructor
3. constructor call must be in 1st step
4. only 1 constructor call in one constructor
5. constructor cannot call itself
6. Child class must call parent class constructor
7. parent class default constructor is called by default in child class
8. if the parent class constructor is not default, it must be called mannually

private constructor:
            is useful when we want to prevent users from creating an object of class.
            Only within the class, we can make a new object of class with private constructor.
What happens when we make Constructor private in Java?
    1.A class cannot be extended when a constructor is declared as private
    2.We cannot create an instance of class when we declare constructor private. If we try, compile-time error will get.
Use of Private Constructor in Java:
    1.Private constructor is used when we want to prevent other classes from creating an object of a class.
    2.It can be used in single tone classes where the object of the class cannot be created outside the class.


object:
	new ExistingConstructor
