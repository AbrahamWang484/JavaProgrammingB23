>>Notes on Interfaces:
1>Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects
(in the example above, it is not possible to create an "Animal" object in the MyMainClass)
2>Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
3>On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
4>Interface methods are by default abstract and public
5>Interface attributes are by default public, static and final
6>An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)

>>Why And When To Use Interfaces?
1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).
2) Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one superclass).
   However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces.
   Note: To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma (see example below).

package name: day52_Abstraction


2 ways of achieving abstraction:
		1. abstract class
		2. interface


Interface (not a class): blue print of the class
						specifies the actions/behaviors that the class need to implement

						public is the only access modifier



Shape:
	Interface Volume:
		volume();

	Abstract Shape
		area();
		perimeter();


	Circle extends Shape
			area(){ r*r*PI }
			perimeter(){ }

	Rectangle extends Shape
			area(){ l * w }
			perimeter(){ }

	Square extends Shape
			area(){ s *s  }
			perimeter(){ }

	Triangle extends Shape
			area(){  }
			perimeter(){  }

	Cube extends Shape implements Volume
			area(){  }
			perimeter(){  }
			volume(){ }

	Cylinder extends Shape implements Volume
			area(){  }
			perimeter(){  }
			volume(){ }

	Tarus extends Shape implements Volume
			area(){  }
