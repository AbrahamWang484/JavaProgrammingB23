package Replit.OOP.Dog;
/*
Write a class Dog that extends the Animal class. Define 2 instance variables for this class: `breed` (String) and `humanYears` (int).
- Add a constructor that accepts three String parameters. The value of the first is used to initialize the value of `name`, the value of the second is used to initialize `age` and the value of the third is used to initialize `breed`.

>Use super() to call parent constructor.

- Override toString() method, so it will display Dog info as in the example below:

  Name: name
  Breed: breed
  Age in calendar years: years
  Age in human years: humanYears
>Hint: Use \n to print a text from a new line.

- Also, implement getAgeInHumanYears method, so It will convert dogs age into humans age as follows:

  if the dog's age is less or equals to 2, multiple age by 11;
  otherwise, human years is equals to: 22 + ((age-2) * 5);

- Override the `equals()` method for the `Dog` class that returns true if the dogâ€™s name, age, and breed match the same variables for the other object that is being compared.
